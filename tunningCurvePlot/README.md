Spike Triggered Average Example
===============================

Example of a leaky integrater model of a neuron.

<h2>How to use this code</h2>
1. Install [Octave free here](https://db.tt/J97Im052) or [Matlab not free here](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/). Note that Octave = Matlab without the nice graphical user interface. I use Octave so don't feel like you are missing anything if you don't have money for Matlab.

2. Fork this repo and clone it locally if you haven't done so already!

3. Navigate to the folder with the above files with ```cd folderNameYouWantToGoIn``` or type ```cd ..``` to go back 1 folder with Octave

4. Type ```runCricketTunningCurvePlot``` in Octave or Matlab command line
