Computational Neuroscience
==========================

*"Computational neuroscience provides tools and methods for characterizing WHAT nervous systems do, determining HOW they function, and understanding WHY they operate in particular ways"*  
  
~ P. Dayan and L. Abbott

<h2>How to use this code</h2>
  1. Install [Octave free here](https://db.tt/J97Im052) or [Matlab not free here](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/). Note that Octave = Matlab without the nice graphical user interface. I use Octave so don't feel like you are missing anything if you don't have money for Matlab.

  2. Fork this repository and clone it locally! Navigate into specific folders (made them very specific) and look at the ```README.md``` file for that specific folder for which file(s) to run to see examples of what computational neuroscience can do! Enjoy!

<h2>What each file/folder in this repository is for:</h2>
  - imagesForExplanation = contains images used in other folder's ```README.md``` files for explanation so don't worry about this folder
  - spikeTriggeredAverage = example code to simulate leaky integrater neuron
  - README.md = the file you are reading right now
