Computational Neuroscience
==========================

*"Computational neuroscience provides tools and methods for characterizing WHAT nervous systems do, determining HOW they function, and understanding WHY they operate in particular ways"*  
~ P. Dayan and L. Abbott

<h2>How to use this code</h2>
  1. Install [Octave free here](https://db.tt/J97Im052) or [Matlab not free here](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/). Note that Octave = Matlab without the nice graphical user interface. I use Octave so don't feel like you are missing anything if you don't have money for Matlab.

  2. Fork this repository and clone it locally! Navigate into specific folders (made them very specific) and look at the ```README.md``` file for that specific folder for which file(s) to run to see examples of what computational neuroscience can do! Enjoy!

<h2>Review</h2>
- What = Descriptive Models
- How = Mechanistic Models
- Why = Interpretive Models

- Receptive Fields = specific properties of a sensory stimulus that generate a strong response from the neuron
  + Support: Hubel and Wiesel, c, 1965
    - Summary: electrodes where implanted in the visual area of a cat's brain. The amazing thing is that specific neurons in the brain only spiked when a bar the cat was looking at was oriented in a certain way. For example, when the bar was vertical a specific set of neurons spiked and when the bar was horizontal another specific set of neurons spiked.
    - Frequency of spikes = function( bar's orientation )
