Computational Neuroscience
==========================

*"Computational neuroscience provides tools and methods for 
characterizing WHAT nervous systems do, determining HOW they function, and understanding WHY they operate in 
particular ways"*  

~ P. Dayan and L. Abbott

What = Descriptive Models
How = Mechanistic Models
Why = Interpretive Models

- Receptive Fields = specific properties of a sensory stimulus that generate a strong response from the neuron
  + Support: Hubel and Wiesel, c, 1965
    - Summary: electrodes where implanted in the visual area of a cat's brain. The amazing thing is that specific neurons in the brain only spiked when a bar the cat was looking at was oriented in a certain way. For example, when the bar was vertical a specific set of neurons spiked and when the bar was horizontal another specific set of neurons spiked.
    - Frequency of spikes = function( bar's orientation )
